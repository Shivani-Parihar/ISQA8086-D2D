## European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS)

> This dataset gives information about the greenhouse gas emissions by various European countries as part of the European Union. The EU emission trading system (ETS) is one of the main measures introduced by the EU to achieve cost-efficient reductions of greenhouse gas emissions and reach its targets under the Kyoto Protocol and other commitments. The data is released from the EU Transaction Log (EUTL). The dataset can help in providing useful information to reduce effects of global warming and countries which are a major factor in causing them.
