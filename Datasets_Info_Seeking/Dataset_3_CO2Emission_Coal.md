## CO2 Emissions from Consumption of Coal

> This dataset gives information about the Carbon Dioxide emissions caused by consumption of Coal by various countries between years 1980 - 2014. This dataset can be used to determine global warming effects and measures can be carried out international unions to reduce the effects. The dataset can used to formulate solutions to use more renewable resources and determine which developed countries should reduce the consumption immediately

#### Dataset Information  
* Data is in .CSV format
* There are 3,183 records of Data and it has 3 attributes(fields) to it

#### Potential Users and Decision Makers for Dataset
* US Energy Department
* International Unions involved to determine CO2 emissions and consumptions made by various countries

#### Three Questions the dataset might help in answering
* Countries with maximum coal consumption for different years
* Countries causing maximum CO2 emissions and increasing coal consumption every year
* Formulate a plan to reduce the coal consumption and assign countries responsible for the same based on the usage
